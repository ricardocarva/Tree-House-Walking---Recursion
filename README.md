# Tree-House-Walking---Recursion
This assignment is intended to make you work with recursion and some permutation.

Problem Description: Tree House Walking There are several trees (an even number) with treehouses in your backyard and you have pitched the bright idea to your parents that it would be fun to connect pairs of tree tops with a rope ladder, so that friends in one tree 
house could get to friends in another tree house without going back to the ground. 
 
Naturally, it would only be fair if each of the tree tops was connected to exactly one another. 
 
Your parents aren't too psyched about the daunting physical task of erecting the rope ladder connections. They've 
decided that they will only do the project if you can match pairs of tree tops in such a way that the total distance 
of rope ladders is minimized. 
 
Assume that the length of a rope ladder built between treetops located at (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is  
 
     ((ùë•ùëñ‚àíùë•ùëó)^2 +(ùë¶ùëñ‚àíùë¶ùëó)^2)^1/2. 
 
Write a program to determine this minimum sum of rope ladder distances so that your treehouse utopia is realized! 
(Note: A valid configuration of rope ladders contains n ladders to connect 2n trees and each tree is connected by 
exactly one rope ladder.) 
 
The Problem 
Given the (x, y) positions of 2n treehouse, of all possible ways to create n pairs of distinct trees, find the minimum 
possible sum of distances between each tree in the pairs. 
 
The Input (to be read from in.txt file) 
The first line will contain a single positive integer, c (c ‚â§ 25), representing the number of test cases to process. 
The test cases follow. 
 
The first line of input for each case will contain a single positive integer, n (n ‚â§ 8), representing that your backyard 
has 2n trees total. 
 
The  following  2n  lines  of  each  input  case  will  contain  a  pair  of  space  separated  positive  integers,  xi  and  yi, 
representing that the ith treetop is located at the coordinate (xi, yi), with -10000 ‚â§ xi, yi ‚â§ 10000.   
 
The Output (to be printed as well as to be written in out.txt file) 
For each input case, output a single floating point number rounded to exactly 3 decimal places, representing the 
minimum sum of distances possible if the rope ladders are built between pairs of trees.

Implementation Restrictions/ Run-Time/Memory Restrictions 
1. For full credit, your algorithm must run in O( n(2n)!/2n) time. In particular, any correct solution which runs 
in O(n(2n)!) time, which tries upto 16! permutations of 16 distinct objects will NOT receive full credit. 
 
2. There are three tiers of credit for this program. If you can get the code to run fast enough for n = 5, then that's 
worth 70% of the points. If you can get it to run fast enough for n = 6, that's worth 90% of the points, and for full 
credit, it has to run fast for n = 8.  
 
The intended run-times are O( (2n)! ) for n = 5, O ( (2n)!/2n ) for n = 6, and O ( (2n)!/ ( 2n * n! ) ) for n = 8. 
 
Note:  It's  completely  okay  if  you  don't  find  a  solution  that  runs  fast  enough  for  n  =  8.  My  expectation  is  that  
students will be able to solve the problem for n = 5. I am curious to see how many can solve it for n = 6 and n = 
8. Both of these require modifications to the permutation code which skip over redundant permutations. 
 
3. For full credit, the function you write to try each possible way of pairing up treetops must be recursive.  
 
4. You must only declare your important variables INSIDE the case loop. 
 
 
 
Deliverables You must submit four files over mimir: 
 
1) A source file, main.c.  
 
2)  A  file  describing  your  testing  strategy,  lastname_Testing.txt  (Changed  from  .docx/.pdf)  .  This  document  
discusses your strategy to create test cases to ensure that your program is working correctly. If you used code to 
create your test cases, just describe at a high level, what your code does, no need to include it. 
 
3) You have to submit one test file test.txt that has at least two test cases. You also need to submit testout.txt file 
that is generated by your code while testing based on your test.txt file. (Note: Hand made test cases should be 
fine. It‚Äôs not necessary to make a max case to get full credit here.) 
 
 
Rubric (subject to change):  
According  to  the  Syllabus,  the  code  will  be  compiled  and  tested  in  Mimir  Platform  for  grading.  If  your  code  does  not  
compile in Mimir, we conclude that your code is not compiling and it will be graded accordingly. We will apply a set of 
test cases to check whether your code can produce the expected output or not. Failing each test case will reduce some grade 
based on the rubric given bellow. If you hardcode the output, you will get -200% for the assignment. Note that we will apply 
more test cases while grading. So, passing the sample test cases might not guarantee that your code will also pass other test 
cases. So, thoroughly test your code. 
1. If  a  code  does  not  compile  the  code  may  get  0.  However,  some  partial  credit  maybe  awarded.  A  code  having  
compiler error cannot get more than 50% even most of the codes are correct 
2. Not using recursion will receive 0 
3. There is no grade for a well indented and well commented code. But a bad indented code will receive 20% penalty. 
Not putting comment in some important block of code -10% 
4. There will be some grade for your test cases and testing strategy 
5. There will be grade for proper permutation implementation 
6. There will be significant amount of grade if your code works for n=5 (~75%) 
7. To get a better grade, your code needs to run fast for n = 6 (~90%) 
8. To get 100%, your code needs to work fast for n=8 as well. 
 
 
Some hints: 
 
- Read the problem completely and try to draw the example points provided in the sample input 
and see how the result is calculated from those points, which points are finally connected to 
minimize the distance.  
- Think, how can you use permutation and the ‚Äúused‚Äù array approach to keep track which tree is 
used in this process 
- Get more concept from the lab problem ‚ÄúDance Recital‚Äù and its solution. This uses the ‚Äúused‚Äù 
array for a different problem scenario and it will help you a lot to solve the assignment problem. 
- Start your coding by loading the test cases and data and make sure you code is able to read them 
properly before processing. 
- Read a test case and process it and then read the next one, etc. 
- Do not wait till the end to test your code. 
- Do not hesitate to take help during all of our office hours. 
 
Good Luck!
